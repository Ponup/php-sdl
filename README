This branch is a full rewrite of PHP sdl extension for new SDL2.

Standard SDL2 API is available in procedural style:

    $w = SDL_CreateWindow(
      "Foo window", 500, 50, 350, 300,
      SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN+SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE);
    SDL_SetWindowTitle($w, "Some new title");
    SDL_DestroyWindow($w);

And is also available in object oriented style:

    $w = new SDL_Window(
      "Foo window", 100, 50, 350, 300,
    SDL_Window::SHOWN|SDL_Window::RESIZABLE);
    $w->SetTitle("Some new title");
    unset($w); // will destroy the window


BUILDING ON UNIX etc.
=====================

To compile your new extension, you will have to execute the following steps:

1.  $ ./phpize
2.  $ ./configure [--enable--sdl] 
3.  $ make
4.  $ make test
5.  $ [sudo] make install



BUILDING ON WINDOWS
===================

Not supported yet.


TESTING
=======

You can now load the extension using a php.ini directive

  extension="sdl.[so|dll]"

or load it at runtime using the dl() function

  dl("sdl.[so|dll]");

The extension should now be available, you can test this
using the extension_loaded() function:

  if (extension_loaded("sdl"))
    echo "sdl loaded :)";
  else
    echo "something is wrong :(";

The extension will also add its own block to the output
of phpinfo();
